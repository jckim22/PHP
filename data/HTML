        Markuo Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup language for documents
    designed to be displayed in a <strong>WEB</strong> <u>browser</u>. It can be assisted by
    technologies
    such as
    Cascading Style Sheets
    (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents
    into
    multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
    included
    cues for
    the appearance of the document.

    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
    such
    as
    interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
    documents
    by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
    other
    items.
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
